# NEWS-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
In the modern digital era, online news platforms generate and distribute massive volumes of information every second. While this has made global information easily accessible, it has also led to the problem of information overload, where users struggle to find articles that match their interests. To address this challenge, this project presents a News Recommendation System that automatically suggests relevant articles to users based on the content of previously read or selected news. The system is built using a Content-Based Filtering approach combined with TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity techniques to analyze and compare textual content. The development process begins with loading and preprocessing the dataset, which includes cleaning the text by removing special characters, links, and unnecessary spaces, and converting all text to lowercase for uniformity. After preprocessing, each news article’s headline and short description are transformed into a numerical feature vector using the TF-IDF method, which effectively represents the importance of words within the document while minimizing the impact of common or less informative words. Once the articles are vectorized, Cosine Similarity is computed to measure the closeness between articles based on their feature vectors. This similarity measure enables the system to identify and recommend the top N most similar news articles to a given article, ensuring that users receive contextually and semantically related recommendations. The project was implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and NumPy, and executed within the Jupyter Notebook environment. A recommendation function was developed to display relevant articles when a user selects a specific piece of news, effectively demonstrating how text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be integrated for intelligent content retrieval. The performance of the system was evaluated using the Precision@K metric, which measures the proportion of correctly recommended articles among the top K suggestions. The results indicate that the model performs efficiently and accurately, providing meaningful recommendations that align well with the original article’s category and topic. This project showcases how traditional machine learning and NLP-based methods can be effectively applied to build recommendation systems that enhance user engagement and reading experience. Although simple compared to deep learning-based approaches, the proposed method achieves a strong balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. The system can be extended to real-world news applications to deliver personalized recommendations, thereby improving the accessibility and relevance of information for users. Future enhancements may include integrating hybrid approaches, semantic embeddings (such as Sentence-BERT), and user interaction data to improve personalization and recommendation quality.

In the digital era, the internet is flooded with enormous amounts of information, especially in the form of online news articles. Users are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content available, making it difficult to find news that matches their interests. This creates a strong need for intelligent systems that can automatically filter and recommend relevant articles. Recommendation systems play a crucial role in solving this issue by suggesting content that aligns with user preferences or content similarity.
